When you have already installed the plugin by moving kiwi-reviews folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory, you will see a menu on the administrator sidebar called 'Kiwi Reviews'.

2. Once the proper API key is inserted, you will be redirected to another page which will display the Google map, where you can find your place or business by using the searchbox above.
3. After you found the place through the searchbox and hit Submit, it will generate a shortcode for you and it will also show you the reviews of that place.
4. To insert the reviews on your page, simply click the Copy button next to the generated shortcode and navigate to the page and press Edit.
